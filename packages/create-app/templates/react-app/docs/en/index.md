## Core Concepts

### 1. Startup Process

The application uses a plugin-based startup process:

```
Bootstrap Initialization → Load Plugins → Initialize Services → Render Application
```

### 2. State Management

Reactive state management based on publish-subscribe pattern:

```
Action Trigger → Store Update → Component Re-render
```

### 3. Routing System

Configuration-based route management:

```
Route Configuration → Auto-generate Routes → Code Splitting → Lazy Loading
```

### 4. Internationalization

Automatic internationalization based on TypeScript comments:

```
Comment Definition → Auto-generate Resources → Dynamic Loading → Language Switching
```
