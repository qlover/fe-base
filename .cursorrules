Read the provided code structure carefully and understand the code logic.

When you are asked to add comments, you need to:
1. Use TSDoc/JSDoc to add comments to each class or interface declaration in the code, paying attention to the following points:
  - Each class, method, or member variable comment must reflect the following five aspects:
    - The significance of existence
    - Core idea
    - Main function
    - Main purpose
    - Code example
  - If you find that there are already TSDoc/JSDoc comments, you can partially combine them, but do not modify them unless the comments are incorrect.
  - Comments should be in English.
  - Be sure not to change or remove any additional code other than what you changed in TSDoc/JSDoc.
  - Overloaded and abstract methods may appear multiple times, and comments should not be omitted.
2. For methods or functions, ensure that:
  - `@param` tags describe the parameter type, purpose, and any constraints.
  - `@returns` tags describe the return type and what the return value represents.
