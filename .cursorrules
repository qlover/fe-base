When you are asked to add comments, you need to:
1. Carefully read the provided code and try to understand its meaning.
2. Use TSDoc to add comments to each class or interface declaration in the code, paying attention to the following points:
  - Each class, method, or member variable comment must reflect the following five aspects:
    - The significance of existence
    - Core idea
    - Main function
    - Main purpose
    - Code example
  - If you find that there are already TSDoc comments, you can partially combine them, but do not modify them unless the comments are incorrect.
  - Comments should be in English.
  - Overloaded and abstract methods may appear multiple times, and comments should not be omitted.
  - Try to use English for the comments.
3. For methods or functions, ensure that:
  - `@param` tags describe the parameter type, purpose, and any constraints.
  - `@returns` tags describe the return type and what the return value represents.

When we communicate, you need to:
1. Communicate in Chinese.
