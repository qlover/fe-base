## Documentation Standards

### Markdown File Rules

- For all md files, language preference is given to the language in the md file, or English if a new file is created.
- AI-generated content for .md files must always be wrapped in code blocks
- Use proper markdown formatting and structure
- Content updates must follow this format:

  ```markdown
  // Original content to be replaced
  ```

  ```markdown
  // New content
  ```
